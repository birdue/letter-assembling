# Letter Assembling

Here's how it works: the point of this game is that you get a bunch of letters, and you try to assemble them into English words, *using every letter exactly once*. It doesn't matter how many words you make, you just have to use all the letters.

For example, if you get `acghorsstu`, you can make `touch` and `grass`.

Oh, there's one other requirement: every word you make must be *at least* 5 (you can change this to make it easier/harder) letters long, so that you don't get away with using a bunch of two-letter words.

This is a script that generates Letter Assembling puzzles with a guaranteed solution. More likely than not, though, there are many solutions to the same puzzle. It's not as hard as you may think.

To get a taste of it, try this:
